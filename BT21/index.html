            <h3>BT21</h3>
            <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DKoKYBhXkAACndc.jpg">
           <p> BTS worked with Webtoon to make their cartoon characters, BT21, into a
            sticker collection for their app LINE. It's basically like emojis for the app
          when you message your friends using the app. There are seven characters
          that was drawn individually by the seven members of BTS to represent them.</p>

<h4> TATA </h4>
        <img src="http://www.bt21.com/img/char_intro_01.gif">
<p> Tata, drawn by V, is an alien from BT planet. He was lonely and wanted to travel
around finding friends. Naturally during his travels to different planet, he gained
a curious personality. Tata can also stretch its limbs at any lengths, and transform himself
 into different objects. When V drew Tata, he wanted him to have a unique look rather
than just look really cute. </p>
    <h4> RJ </h4>
        <img src="http://www.bt21.com/img/char_intro_03.gif">
<p> RJ, drawn by Jin, is an alpaca that enjoys eating (much like his creator Jin).
   He is kind and polite, and the cutest while mumbling. RJ wears a parka he got from
   Machu Piccu and wears it because he gets cold easily. RJ as well is from Machu Piccu.
 Jin had been working on the drawings for RJ for months and really wanted to go
 for a cute looking character. </p>
      <h4> CHIMMY </h4>
        <img src="http://www.bt21.com/img/char_intro_04.gif">
<p> Chimmy, drawn by Jimin, wears a yellow hoodie, and always has his tongue out.
Chimmy was born with passion and tries hard at everything, being nicknamed the
king of passion. But he is also considered a charming narcissit. Its believed Jimin
got his idea for the look from when Jimin himself had to wear a dog onesie and pretend
to be a dog for their small skit: House of Army. </p>
        <h4> COOKY </h4>
            <img src="http://www.bt21.com/img/char_intro_05.gif">
<p> Cooky, drawn by Jungkook, is a pink bunny, with a unique eyebrow, whose goal is to be strong. His workout routine consists of doing two hours on the "running machine"
400 push-ups, and 100 minutes of eyebrow drawing. Cooky is rough to everyone, but
even rougher to his friends. When he's angry, he changes from a small bunny, to a big
muscular bunny. Jungkook is already a good artist, so when he first drew Cooky,
he made him look to realistic, like a person's face with bunny ears. Then he drew
the bunny to be tall with abs and strong arms, which RM
joked saying you drew a self portrait, as Jungkook's body is similar to what
he originally drew.    </p>
          <h4> SHOOKY </h4>
              <img src="http://www.bt21.com/img/char_intro_06.gif">
<p> Shooky, drawn by Suga, is the smallest character. Although he looks like a cookie
and his enenmy is milk (hates milk a lot) he says he is a really delicious shooky,
not a cookie. He usually naps with Koya and although he's tiny, he can be loud
and make a mess. Shooky often argues with Cooky.  </p>
            <h4> MANG </h4>
              <img src="http://www.bt21.com/img/char_intro_07.gif">
<p> Mang, drawn by J-Hope, is nicknamed the dancing king/ dancing machine,
  just how J-Hope loves to dance and is the main dancer. He is always break dancing
  and is sweet. He wears a horse mask always. Thus, no one knows his true face.
  With his friends, he's always happy, making jokes, and acts cool. But underneath
  it all, he hides his true self and is the sensitive one.
              <h4> KOYA </h4>
                  <img src="http://www.bt21.com/img/char_intro_08.gif">
<p> Koya, drawn by RM, has droopy eyes, and a docile apperance. But, Koya is a koala
that has a surprisingly delicate and sharp judgement, plus musical skills.
He sometimes looks like he's sleeping, but is actually deeply thinking.
Also he is actually suffering from insomnia. Many moments, Koya thinks a lot
but when he thinks about his big ears falling off, he gets startled.
 </p>
                  <h4> VAN </h4>
                    <img src="http://www.bt21.com/img/char_intro_02.gif">
<p> Van represents ARMY! It is a giant space robot that protects BT21. Van is a
reprsentation of ARMY because half of the robot is white and grey, symbolically
representing day and night and how ARMYs live around the world and live in differnt time zones.
The X and O, being the eyes of Van, is like hugs and kisses, as BTS loves ARMY.  </p>
