           <h4> RM (Kim Namjoon)</h4>
            <p> RM, once Rap Monster, is the leader of the group and one of the rappers of the group.He was the first one recruited for the group and only one who can speak English fluently, thus he is usually the one who does the talking in English interviews. When BTS is writing their own songs, usually the producers take RM's writing into the songs. His IQ is said to be on the genius level. Although he is the leader, he is not the oldest member. He was born on September 12, 1994, has a dog name Rapmon, and is the clumsiest member of thr group. He has been seen in videos breaking glasses he just bought, beds, the glass floor from dancing, and even simply standing there but the bag he was carrying ripped. RM used to be called Rap Monster, but he felt as he got older he wanted a more professional name so he initialized it, into RM. RM also has his own songs such as Change with rapper Wale. RM is highly respected by his other members and although may have a strong apperance, he is very sweet.

          <p> Jin is the oldest member of thr group and one of the vocalists. He was born on December 4th, 1992.
            He can cook and used to cook often for the members when they first

            and eats food and discussing how he and BTS are doing as well as answering ARMYs questions He enjoys Nitendo, romances, and especially making dad jokes.

He now has two sugar gliders. Jin revealed this year his background of his family, being that his father is a CEO of a company, but he didnt reveal which because he wants to keep things private. He also has one older brother.
            There are no pictures out either of how his parents look.He was seen as the
            underrated member as he would not have a lot of lines and was seen as
            the least best dancers. But after a incident where Jin was cropped out of a photo,
            ARMYs constantly spoke out on the issue. Thus they worked out the issue. His laugh is also compared to a window being wiped
            and has been nicknamed by people unknown of him as, car door boy, third one to the left, third to the right
            and handsome guy who can cook.

          <h4> Suga (Min Yoongi) </h4>
          <p> Suga is another rapper in the group and got his name because when
            he smiles he looks sweet like sugar. Suga is from Daegu was born on March 9th, 1993,
            but is jokingly called the child of the group by members, but grandpa by ARMYs.
            He is very passionate about music. Before debut he started
            music in 6th grade. In middle school he learned classical composition
            and started writng songs daily after that. Before BTS, he was very poor and it also
            affected his mental health, He gravely suffered depression as he speaks
            about in his mixtape Agust D, song Last of Me. He dreamt of going far with music
            that he would have to choose between either spening money on food or
            transportation to take him to places that will help him continue his music.
            This has caused him to go nights and days without eating. Now he spends
            hours in his own little studio, working on music and song writing.
            Suga although in pictures he looks sweet, he is also considered the
            "savage" of the group, making sarcastic remarks and making faces
            when members act silly or extra. He has a dog named Holy, loves to play the piano,
          and is really good at playing basketball, and loves to sleep. </p>

                He can also sing and sometimes takes part as a vocalist in the group.
                Jhope was born on February 18, 1994 in Gwangju. In the beginning, RM says he has
                never seen a kid more depressed than J-Hope. Now he is
                 nicknamed the Sunshine of the group, as his smile and laugh is so contagious,
                 it warms our hearts.
                He is often extremely cheerful and most energetic of the group.
                J-Hope had been dancing before BTS and used to be backup dancer for others.
                His father did not approve of him wanting to dance and to look into
                something more practical, but his mother continued to support him,
                thus the reason he became the man he is today (which is discussed
                in his solo songs in Wings, Mama). Pre-debut J-Hope was a part of
                a street dance team, called NEURON. He won an underground dance battle
                and even performed at a festival. J-Hope used to be a tennis player
                in elementary school and played in competitions. He once received a bronze medal,

             <p> Jimin was born on October 13, 1995. He is nicknamed Chim Chim and mochi as he had chubby cheeks
             when they first debuted, and it reminded fans of the Japanese rice cake.
             He was recruited from his local province of Busan as part of Big Hit's "Hit It"
             auditions in 2010 and 2011 to be a part of Bangtan Boys.

             the high notes and posts the most on their twitter page. He has a very
             sweet and shy personality, but also has a very flirty side to him as well.
             It was revealed this year after their comeback in September 2017,
             that he had almost been kicked out of the group before their debut date (June 13, 2013)
           several times, even once the day before the debut.
           The reason being that people assumed he would not make it or keep up
         with the group, or be popular with the fans. He also over the years has been
         struggling with body image issues and self esteem. Jimin put himself stricter
         diets and would often feel light headed and faint when dancing for music videos
          or doing dance practice. He now has assured fans he will no longer be
          doing these diets and will stay healthy and eat well.  </p>
