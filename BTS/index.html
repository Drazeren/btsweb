          <h6> <h6>
          <p> BTS is a seven member korean pop boy group. The members include
            RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V, and Jungkook. They first debuted on June 13, 2013 with their first single No More Dream, discussing
            the societal issues that are pressured against the youth. Their name BTS,
             Bangtan Sonyeondan in korean/Bulletproof Boyscouts was created
            by rapper and main dancer of the group, J-Hope. He chose this name to express
            how they will block the prejudice and supression those in their teens
            and 20s and protect our value through our music. BTS came from BigHit Entertainment,
            a small company in Seoul, South Korea. In 2013, they released two mini albums,
            2 Cool 4 Skool and O!RUL8,2? This was the start of their Skool trilogy and their fame
            slowly started to rise.  <p/>

            <h4> 2014 </h4>
            <img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/bangtan/images/c/c0/Bts-main.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/640?cb=20140914064650">
             <p> In 2014 they released Skool Luv Affair, their third mini album and their first official
       album, Dark & Wild. Unfortunately, things were not looking up for BigHit. BigHit was getting
     broke and not having a lot of money to have the best clothes, luxurious music videos,
   or even a full music studio. They made Dark & Wild in a garage. But before this, BTS was
 given the opportunity to go to LA. For some of the members it was their first time going to
America. BTS was invited to a Korean Convention (KCON) and worked with MNET (major korean television network)
and do a show called American Hustle. They have korean idols learn more about the American culture
and pushes them to talk to citizens of America. They were given a job (some had to clean airplanes,
others work on a boat, and a restaraunt) having to try to speak/ practice their English,
 and were around in LA asking people to come to their free concert, handing out flyers.
Because BTS was from a small company, BigHit Entertainment, they were being overrun by
bigger companies such as JYP, YG, and SM. They were compared to these well know companies and mocked by news outlets,
magazines, and even some other rappers, talking down on BTS, saying how they will
never make it far and end up failing. But little did they know that this is what pushed
them to work harder, to prove that they don't have to have a wealthy family or giant company
to be one of the bests.  </p>
          <h4> 2015 </h4>
    <img src="https://pm1.narvii.com/6303/c2bc54b537c5261d1d00ead962b542a58e66f633_hq.jpg">
      <p> BTS started to become bigger not only in Korea, but slowly internationally,
      becoming popular more in Japan, America, even Europe. They released two mini albums,
    The Most Beautiful Moments in Life Pt. 1 & 2. This era is usually amongst the
  favorite for most ARMYs because BTS came up with concepts that were so different
and thought provoking. It brought up the issue on mental health and suicide, something
that in South Korea is not talked about as it over there is more conservative.  </p>

         <h4> 2016 </h4>

       <p>They kept making achievement after achievement this year and at some point this year after
   releasing their second official album, Wings, this is when BTS popularity really started
   to grow (and the year I officially became an ARMY). BTS also came out with album
   The Most Beautiful Moments in Life: Young Forever (Epilogue) including new tracks, FIRE, Save
   Me, Epilogue: Young Forever, and remixes of songs from Pt. 1 and Pt. 2. Their album Wings
   was the highest charting KPOP album, best selling KPOP album,  and No 2. on Worldwide Itunes
   Albums Chart. Their main track, Blood Sweat & Tears was a music video broke record form
   most views within 24 hours for a KPOP group, nominated for Best music video in 2016,
   and ranked as No. 1 in overall music videos in U.S. Itunes chart.

 <p>They made it to the Billboard Hot 200, won awards in Korea such as Best Dance Performance Male Group,
   South Korea Pop Culture Award, and Best Icon. BTS has additionally won their first two
   Daesungs (awards) from MAMAs (MNET Asian Music Awards; considered as Asian Grammys),
   the Artist of the Year and Album of the Year. When they won their Daesungs and were incredibly
 shocked to hear their name. They were moved and most of the members cried accepting
the award on stage. </p>

   <p> In November 2016, they announced their first World Wide tour that year for their album Wings. The day tickets
   were released, tickets sold out in 3-5 minutes all in the different countries
 they would be performing at their concerts for such as Seoul Korea, Japan, New York,
Chile, Chicago, and Los Angeles. For most arenas, they added an extra day because fans
begged BigHit to add an extra day since tickets sold out very quickly. They planned
to tour in February 2017.   </p>

   <p> BTS came out with You Never Walk Alone on February 13 (KST), a extended version
   to their album Wings. It came with new photos and four more tracks. Their music
 videos Spring Day and Not Today beat Blood Sweat and Tears records in being most viewed
KPOP video in 24 hours. Then not too long after release of the album, they started
their first World Tour, The Wings Tour: BTS Live Trilogy Episode III. They toured
in few states in America, Chile, Brazil, Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, Phillipines, Malaysia,
Australia, Thailand, Indonesia, and ending it on December 10th back in Seoul, South
Korea. Because they toured in the states, they were getting more recognition from
magazines, as well as beause of the popularity BTS has on social media such as twitter, instagram
and youtube. If people reacted to BTS music videos, they would get tons of views
because the fanbase, as well as BTS and the company enjoyed reacts and thoughts from
people. This did however also gave people the chance to use BTS for fame and get lots
of views. </p>

  <p> The biggest social media impact was when BTS was nominated for a Billboard Music
 Award, the top social artist. This was a fan vote award, and they were up against
bigger and more well known American artists such as Selena Gomez, Ariana Grande, Shawn
Mendes, and Justin Bieber, who won this award six years in a row. BTS won this award, with over
300 million votes. They were the first to beat Justin Bieber, and were trending all day worldwide,
not only for their win but even earlier as ARMYs were excited to see BTS at the BBMAs,
their first American Award show, and as the first KPOP group to be invited, nominated, and first
to win an award. This is also added more ARMYs as people were interested in knowing
who this group was. </p>

<p> In the speech for the Billboard Music Awards, RM tells ARMYs to remember to love yourself.
This was then revealed that this was a hint to their next concept, being Love Yourself.
They announced they were going to release a drama with BTS members acting in it, and a new album
self titled Love Yourself. This album has been their biggest album yet, as it had over 1 million
preorders, was #1 album in Itunes Albums chart in 73 countries, title track DNA's music video
was the most viewed KPOP music video in 24 hours, with over 20 million views in 24 hours,
and fasted musi video to reach 1 million likes, and DNA reached the Billboard Hot 100
for four weeks. </p>

   <p> In November, BigHit Entertainment revelaed that BTS was coming to Los Angeles
     as they were invited to several talk show hosts such as The Late Late Show
   with James Corden, Jimmy Kimmel Live, and The Ellen Show. The biggest reason
 why they were in LA was because they were invited to perform their hit song DNA at
the America Music Awards on November 19. This was their first time performing at an American music award
show. They then the following week they released a remix version of their song Mic Drop,
as they collabed with rapper Desiigner and DJ Steve Aoki. The song reached #1 on
Itunes song chart. </p>
